What is Spring
==============
Spring is a singleton factory design pattern implementation

spring framework instantiate and keep the Objects in Spring framework

Objective : To Simplify and Accelerate the Complete Enterprise Applications
type: open source software.

latest version: spring 7.0x

Steps to prepare Spring applications
====================================
1. prepare persistence class or pojo class
2. Prepare Spring Configuration file
   ---------------------------------
   Spring configuration file is an xml file, it must have all the bean classes configuration details which are required by the container in order to create bean Objects and in order to 	supply that bean Objects to the application.

<bean>
<bean id="----" class="----">
<property name="----" value="----">
</bean>
</beans>

where beans is a root tag it includes a number of bean configurations.
where <bean> tag Is able to provide single bean class configuration. 
where id attribute in<bean> tag will provide identity for the bean Object.
where class attribute will take the fully qualified name of the bean class.

3. prepare the client application.
   -------------------------------
   the main intention of test application is 

	1. create a Container
	  -------------------
          The main purpose of container is to create bean objects to manage bean objects along with their identities.

          Spring framework has provided the following two types of IOC (inverse of containers)containers.

          1. BeanFactory (depricated)
		basic IOC Container
		Lazy initialization(beans created only when requested)
		Lightweight, not commonly used in modern apps.
          2. ApplicationContext
		Advanced container with enterprise features.
		Eager initialization (beans created at startup).
		Support internationalization, event propagation and AOP
		Most commonly used container in spring applications.

	   To Represent ApplicationContext containers SpringFramework has provided a predefined interface in the form of applicationContext and spring framework has provided an       	  	   implementation class or ApplicationContext in the form of ClassPathXmlApplicationContext.

	   to create ClassPathXmlApplicationContext Object we have to use the following contructor.
 
	   public ClassPathXmlApplicatonContext(Spring configureFilePath)

	   ex:
           ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("SpringConfig.xml");

           When we create a container Object like Above Container will perform the following Actions.
           1. identify the Spring ConfigureFile
           2. when spring configuration is identified container will perform loading configuration file parsing configuration file and reading data from configuration.
	   3. after getting the data from ConfigurationFile container will recognize all the bean configuration and container will create Objects for all the bean classes which we  		   configure in the spring configuration file
	   4. after creating bean Objects container will manage all the bean Objects along with their identity values.


	2. Get a Bean Object from container
	   --------------------------------
	   to get a particular bean object from container we have to use the following method from applicationContext.

           public Object getBean(String idValue)

           ex:
	   Person person = context.getBean("person");
	3. Accesses Business methods of the Respective Bean.
